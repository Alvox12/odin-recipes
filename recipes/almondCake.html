        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
          This delicious Spanish almond cake is one of the most popular desserts
          in all of Spain. My traditional tarta de Santiago recipe combines
          ground almonds, sugar, and eggs for a quick, moist, (and gluten free!)
          cake that’s easy to make at home in less than one hour!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups ground almonds Very full cups (250 g)</li>
          <li>1 1/4 cups sugar (250 g)</li>
          <li>5 eggs</li>
          <li>lemon zest from half a lemon</li>
          <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
          <li>1 tbsp liquor (15 ml) - Your preference</li>
          <li>Powdered sugar to dust</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Crack the eggs into a large bowl and add the sugar. Beat until the
            mixture lightens in color then add the lemon zest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the liquor and the cinnamon and mix well. Then fold in the
            ground almonds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grease a mold and add the batter. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 30-40
            minutes (until light brown and a toothpick comes out clean).
          </li>
          <li>
            When the cake is done, allow it to cool. Then use a stencil to make
            the shape of the Saint James cross on top. Cover the cake with the
            cutout and dust with powdered sugar. When totally covered, carefully
            remove the stencil. Voila! A beautiful tarta de Santiago!
